# dooitcli

A CLI companion tool to do with [dooit](https://github.com/dooit-org/dooit)

</div>

## What is this?

dooitcli is a CLI tool built around the dooit API, capable of querying your todos,
exporting todos to Markdown, and more.

This project is first and foremost a hobby project to practice Python. Since I use and
enjoy dooit, it provides me great motivation.

Still, it would mean a lot if this ends up helpful to anyone.

## Why a CLI?

dooitcli seeks not to replace dooit, but to complement it with the advantages of a CLI.

To that effect, it should be simple and direct:

- Just type what you want and see a result
- Relatively quick (well, for Python, that is)

And with self-imposed limitations:

- No dependencies outside what dooit already has and the Python standard library
- No features that would be clunky with a CLI (e.g. adding todos, deleting todos, etc.)

Any ideas or improvements you think would work? Feel free to suggest them!
